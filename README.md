# L-System-Interpreter

This is an L-system interpreter; it utilizes the Turtle Graphics library in Python for visualizing any L-System drawing instructions. Lindenmayer Systems (L-Systems) were first created by biologist Aristid Lindenmayer for modeling plant structures and growth patterns, however, they can also be used for other procedurally generated designs such as fractals. An L-System is created with an axiom, one or more redrawing rules, a number of iterations (i.e. how many times the redrawing rules are applied), and a few other values such as angle or line length.
